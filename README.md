# Requirement
python==3.8\
torch==1.11.0+cu102\
cudatoolkit==11.3\
huggingface-hub\
transformers\

# Preprocessing
We use Tree-sitter to generate the AST and we provide a compiled version of Tree-sitter [here](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). It should be noted that the AST generated by different versions of Tree-sitter may have significant differences. So if using the newer versions of Tree-sitter to generate AST, the model may have a different performance compared with the results we reported in the paper.

# Running the model
The model implementation code is under the `code\` folder. The model can be runned from `code\run.sh`.\

# Result
We put the results and figures in `results\` folder
